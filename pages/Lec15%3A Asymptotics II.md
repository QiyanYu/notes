- ### Techniques:
	- Find exact sum
	- Write out examples
	- Draw pictures
- ### Sum Things to Know
	- 1+2+3+...+*Q*=*Q*(*Q*+1)/2=Θ(*Q*​2​​) (Sum of First Natural Numbers)
	  1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + Q = 2Q - 1 = \Theta(Q)1+2+4+8+...+*Q*=2*Q*−1=Θ(*Q*) (Sum of First Powers of 2)

- ### Log time is super good!
	- It's almost as fast as constant time, and way better than linear time.
	- *N*​^2​​ vs. *N**l**o**g**N*. *N**l**o**g**N* is an enormous difference.
	- Going from *N**l**o**g**N* to *N* is nice, but not a radical change.

- ### Summary
	- Big O is an upper bound ("less than or equals")
	- Big Omega is a lower bound ("greater than or equals")
	- Big Theta is both an upper and lower bound ("equals")
	- Big O does NOT mean "worst case". We can still describe worst cases using Big Theta
	- Big Omega does NOT mean "best case". We can still describe best cases using Big Theta
	- Big O is sometimes colloquially used in cases where Big Theta would provide a more precise statement
	- Amortized analysis provides a way to prove the average cost of operations.
	- If we chose a_i​​ such that Φ​_i​​ is never negative and a_i​​ is constant for all i, then the amortized cost is an upper bound on the true cost.
