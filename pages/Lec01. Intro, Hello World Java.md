- #java
- ## Java and Object Orientation
	- Every Java file must contain a class declaration. (or interfaces)
	- **All code** lives inside a class, even helper functions, global constants, etc.
- ## Reflections on Static Typing
	- The Good:
		- Catches certain types of errors, making ti easier on the programmer to debug their code.
		- Type errors can (almost) never occur on end user's computer.
		- Makes it easier to read and reason about code.
		- Code can run more efficiently, e.g. no need to do expensive runtime type checks.
	- The Bad:
		- Code is more verbose.
		- Code is less general.
