- ### Nested Class
	- Can combine two classes into one file.
	- Nested Classes are useful when a class doesn't stand on its own and is obviously subordinate to another class.
	- Make the nested class private if other classes should never use the nested class.
- ### Static Nested Class
	- If the nested class never uses any instance variables or methods of the outer class, declare it static.
	- This means the `inner class` doesn't get a reference to it boss.
	- Static classes cannot access outer class's instance variables and methods.
	- Results in a minor savings of memory, since each `inner static class` no longer needs to keep track of how to access its enclosing `outer class`.
	- **Note:** it can access `outer class static variables`.
