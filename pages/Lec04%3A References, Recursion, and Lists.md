- ### Reference Types
  collapsed:: true
	- There are 8 primitive types in Java:
		- byte, short, **int**, long, float, **double**, boolean, char
	- Everything else, including arrays, is a **reference type.**
- ### Reference Types Variable Declarations
	- When we declare a variable of any reference type (Walrus, Dog, Planet):
		- Java allocates exactly a box of size 64 bits, no matter what type of object.
		- These bits can be either set to:
			- Null (all zeros).
			- The 64 bit "address" of a specific instance of that class (return by *new*).
		- Before the box been set, it's undefined, not null.

- ### Reference Types Obey the Golden Rule of Equals
	- Just as with primitive types, the equals sign copies the bits.
		- In terms of our visual metaphor, we “copy” the arrow by making the arrow in the b box point at the same instance as a.
- ### The Golden Rule of Equals (and Parameter Passing)
	- Passing parameters obeys the same rule: Simply **copy the bits** to the new scope.
