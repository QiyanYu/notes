- ### BST Performance:
	- Worst case `theta(N)` height.
	- Best case `theta(log N)` height.
	- `theta(log N)` height if constructed via random inserts.
	- But we can't always insert our items in a random order.
		- Data comes in over time, don't have all at once.
- ### B Tree
	- #### B-Tree Invariants
		- All leaves must be the same distance from the source.
		- A non-leaf node with k items must have exactly k+1 children.
	- Nodes may contain between 1 and L items.
	- contains works almost exactly like a normal BST.
	- add works by adding items to existing leaf nodes.
	- If nodes are too full, they split.
	- Resulting tree has perfect balance. Runtime for operations is O(log N).
	- B-trees are more complex, but they can efficiently handle ANY insertion order.
