title:: 502. IPO

- # Description
	- Suppose LeetCode will start its **IPO** soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the **IPO**. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most `k` distinct projects before the **IPO**. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most `k` distinct projects.
	  
	  You are given `n` projects where the `ith` project has a pure profit `profits[i]` and a minimum capital of `capital[i]` is needed to start it.
	  
	  Initially, you have `w` capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.
	  
	  Pick a list of **at most** `k` distinct projects from given projects to **maximize your final capital**, and return *the final maximized capital*.
	  
	  The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.
	  
	   
	  
	  **Example 1:**
	  
	  ```
	  **Input:** k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]
	  **Output:** 4
	  **Explanation:** Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
	  After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
	  With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
	  Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
	  Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.
	  ```
	  
	  **Example 2:**
	  
	  ```
	  **Input:** k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]
	  **Output:** 6
	  ```
	  
	   
	  
	  **Constraints:**
	- `1 <= k <= 105`
	- `0 <= w <= 109`
	- `n == profits.length`
	- `n == capital.length`
	- `1 <= n <= 105`
	- `0 <= profits[i] <= 104`
	- `0 <= capital[i] <= 109`
- # Approach
	- To select a project, we choose the one that has the maximum profit that can be afforded with the available `w`.
	- To accomplish this, we first store each project's `{capital, profits}` as a pair in an array. We then sort the array in increasing order based on `capital`.
	- Next, we put all the profits that are less than or equal to `w` into a priority queue (PQ), and select the project with the highest profit. We then update the value of `w`, and add all the profits whose capital is less than the updated `w` back into the PQ.
- # Solution
	- ```java
	  // time:  O(NlogN + klogN)
	  // space: O(n)
	  class Solution {
	      private static final int CAPITAL = 0;
	      private static final int PROFITS = 1;
	  
	      public int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int w, int[] profits, int[] capital) {
	          int n = profits.length;
	          int[][] arr = new int[n][2];
	          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	              arr[i][CAPITAL] = capital[i];
	              arr[i][PROFITS] = profits[i];
	          }
	          Arrays.sort(arr, (a, b) -> a[CAPITAL] - b[CAPITAL]);
	  
	          PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
	          int curr = 0;
	          while (k-- > 0) {
	              while (curr < n && arr[curr][CAPITAL] <= w) {
	                  pq.add(arr[curr][PROFITS]);
	                  curr++;
	              }
	              if (pq.isEmpty()) {
	                  break;
	              }
	              w += pq.poll();
	          }
	          return w;
	      }
	  }
	  ```
