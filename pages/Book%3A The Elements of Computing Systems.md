- # 1. Boolean Logic
	- ## 1.1 Boolean Algebra
		- Boolean Functions
			- truth table
			- boolean expressions
		- Boolean Operators
	- ## 1.2 Logic Gates
		- Boolean algebra can be used to abstract the behavior of logic gates.
		- Don't worry about physical artifacts.
		- **The art of logic design:** Given a gate abstraction (also referred to as *specification* or *interface*), find an efficient way to implement it using other gates that were already implemented.
	- ## 1.3 Hardware Construction
		- ### Hardware Description Language (HDL)
		- ### Simulator
	- ## 1.4 Specification
		- Multi-Bit Version of Basic Gates
			- The bits are indexed from right to left, the rightmost bit being the 0'th bit and the leftmost bit being the 15'th bit (in a 16-bit setting).
	- ## 1.5 Implementation
		- General approaches:
			- behavioral simulation
			- hardware implementation
		-
