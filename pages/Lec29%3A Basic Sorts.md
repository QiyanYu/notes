- ## Selection Sort
	- time: O(N^2)
- ## Heap sort
	- time: O(NlogN)
- ## Merge Sort
- ## Insertion Sort
	- ### Insertion Sort Sweet Spots
		- On arrays with a small number of inversions, insertion sort is extremely fast.
			- One exchange per inversion (and number of comparisons is similar). Runtime is Θ(N + K) where K is number of inversions.
			- Define an ***almost sorted*** array as one in which number of inversions ≤ cN for some c. Insertion sort is excellent on these arrays.
		- Less obvious: For small arrays (N < 15 or so), insertion sort is fastest.
			- More of an empirical fact than a theoretical one.
			- Theoretical analysis beyond scope of the course.
			- Rough idea: Divide and conquer algorithms like heapsort / mergesort spend too much time dividing, but insertion sort goes straight to the conquest.
