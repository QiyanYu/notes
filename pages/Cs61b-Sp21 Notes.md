		- ### evaluate expression
			- A good use of this functionality is to ensure that two objects in your code are equal (rather than being two instances of the same class) by evaluating a == b which can be difficult to tell from the Variables Panel alone. This has the added benefit of not changing any values in the code, so you donâ€™t have to worry about accidentally modifying the behavior you trying to observe.
