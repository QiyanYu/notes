- ## Java's Just-In-Time Compiler
	- ### Java’s Just-In-Time Compiler secretly optimizes your code when it runs.
		- #### The code you write is not necessarily the code that executes!
		- #### As your code runs, the “interpreter” is watching everything that happens.
			- If some segment of code is called many times, the interpreter actually studies and re-implements your code based on what it learned by watching WHILE ITS RUNNING (!!).
