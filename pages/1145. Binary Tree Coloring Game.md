title:: 1145. Binary Tree Coloring Game

- ## Description
	- Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree. We are given the `root` of this binary tree, and the number of nodes `n` in the tree. `n` is odd, and each node has a distinct value from `1` to `n`.
	  
	  Initially, the first player names a value `x` with `1 <= x <= n`, and the second player names a value `y` with `1 <= y <= n` and `y != x`. The first player colors the node with value `x` red, and the second player colors the node with value `y` blue.
	  
	  Then, the players take turns starting with the first player. In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an **uncolored** neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)
	  
	  If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn. If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.
	  
	  You are the second player. If it is possible to choose such a `y` to ensure you win the game, return `true`. If it is not possible, return `false`.
	  
	   
	  
	  **Example 1:**
	  
	  ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/08/01/1480-binary-tree-coloring-game.png){:height 471, :width 747}
	  
	  ```
	  **Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], n = 11, x = 3
	  **Output:** true
	  **Explanation: **The second player can choose the node with value 2.
	  ```
	  
	  **Example 2:**
	  
	  ```
	  **Input:** root = [1,2,3], n = 3, x = 1
	  **Output:** false
	  ```
	  
	   
	  
	  **Constraints:**
	- The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
	- `1 <= x <= n <= 100`
	- `n` is odd.
	- 1 <= Node.val <= n
	- All the values of the tree are **unique**.
- ## Solution 1: DFS / Recursion
	- ```java
	  class Solution {
	      // After the first player makes their choice, 
	      // the tree is divided into three subtrees: 
	      // the left subtree, the right subtree, and the remaining nodes.
	      // If the second player selects a subtree with more than half
	      // of the total nodes, they will win the game as they are 
	      // only able to choose one subtree.
	      private int leftCnt = 0;
	      private int rightCnt = 0;
	  
	      public boolean btreeGameWinningMove(TreeNode root, int n, int x) {
	          dfs(root, x);
	          int remain = n - 1 - leftCnt - rightCnt;
	          return leftCnt > n / 2 || rightCnt > n / 2 || remain > n / 2;
	  
	      }
	  
	      private int dfs(TreeNode node, int target) {
	          if (node == null) {
	              return 0;
	          }
	          int left = dfs(node.left, target);
	          int right = dfs(node.right, target);
	          if (node.val == target) {
	              leftCnt = left;
	              rightCnt = right;
	          }
	          return 1 + left + right;
	      }
	  }
	  ```
- ## Solution 2: BFS / Iteration
	- ```java
	  class Solution {
	      // After the first player makes their choice, 
	      // the tree is divided into three subtrees: 
	      // the left subtree, the right subtree, and the remaining nodes.
	      // If the second player selects a subtree with more than half
	      // of the total nodes, they will win the game as they are 
	      // only able to choose one subtree.
	      public boolean btreeGameWinningMove(TreeNode root, int n, int x) {
	          TreeNode tarNode = find(root, x);
	          int leftCnt = count(tarNode.left);
	          int rightCnt = count(tarNode.right);
	          int remain = n - 1 - leftCnt - rightCnt;
	          return leftCnt > n / 2 || rightCnt > n / 2 || remain > n / 2;
	  
	      }
	  
	      private TreeNode find(TreeNode root, int target) {
	          Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
	          q.offer(root);
	          while (!q.isEmpty()) {
	              TreeNode currNode = q.poll();
	              if (currNode == null) {
	                  continue;
	              }
	              if (currNode.val == target) {
	                  return currNode;
	              }
	              q.offer(currNode.left);
	              q.offer(currNode.right);
	          }
	          return null;
	      }
	  
	      private int count(TreeNode root) {
	          int cnt = 0;
	          Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
	          q.offer(root);
	          while (!q.isEmpty()) {
	              TreeNode currNode = q.poll();
	              if (currNode == null) {
	                  continue;
	              }
	              q.offer(currNode.left);
	              q.offer(currNode.right);
	              cnt += 1;
	          }
	          return cnt;
	      }
	  }
