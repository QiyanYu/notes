- ## Lecture
	- `http-server` only serves static context, it cannot process the data that coming into it.
	- You don't want to use client's side safety check since clients can use chrome development tool to remove the restrictions on HTML and tease your server.
	- MVC model (vs Swift MVVM model)
- ## Shorts
	- ### Flask
		- Flask has a number of functions within its module that will be useful for application development.
			- `url_for()`
			- `redirect()`
			- `session()`
			- `render_template()`
		- Always comes with  [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) to mix HTML and Python.
	- ### Ajax
		- Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
		- Ajax allows us to dynamically update a webpage even more dynamically.
		- Central to our ability to asynchronously update our pages is to make use of a special JavaScript object called an XMLHttpRequest.
		- `var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();`
		- After obtaining your new object, you need to define its `onreadystatechange` behavior.
			- This is a function (typically an anonymous function) that will be called when the asynchronous HTTP request has completed, and thus typically defines what is expected to change on your site.
		- XMLHttpRequsts have two additional properties that are used to detect when the page finishes loading.
			- The `readyState` property will change from 0 (request not yet initialized) to 1, 2, 3, and finally 4 (request finished, response ready).
			- The `status` property will (hopefully!) be 200(OK).
			- Then just make your asynchronous request using the `open()` method to define the request and the `send()` method to actually send it.
		- More commonly, you'll see Ajax request written using jQuery instead of "raw" JavaScript.
