- `BiFunction` is a functional interface in the Java programming language that represents a function that takes two arguments and returns a result. It is a part of the Java 8 functional interfaces and is defined in the `java.util.function` package.
  title:: BiFunction in Java
- A `BiFunction` has the following signature:
- ```java
  @FunctionalInterface
  public interface BiFunction<T, U, R> {
      R apply(T t, U u);
  }
  ```
- It takes two generic types: `T`, `U` as input and returns a generic type `R`. The `apply()` method is the functional method of the interface and it takes two arguments of types `T` and `U` and returns a result of type `R`.
- `BiFunction` is used in various methods of the Java 8 libraries, such as `merge()`, `compute()`, and `replaceAll()`, to provide a functional way to define how to combine or modify values for a given key in a map.
- For example, in the case of `TreeMap.merge()` it takes two arguments, key, and value, and a `BiFunction` to define how to combine the new value with the existing value in the map.
- In the case of `map1.merge(num, 1, Integer::sum)` the BiFunction is `Integer::sum` which takes two arguments, the existing value and the value being merged, and returns the sum of these two values.
- ```java
  TreeMap<Integer, Integer> map1 = new TreeMap<>();
  map1.put(1, 5);
  map1.put(2, 2);
  
  int num = 1;
  map1.merge(num, 1, Integer::sum);
  
  System.out.println(map1);
  ```
	- Output : {1=6, 2=2}
- If we don't use `BiFunction` we need to write a function explicitly.
	- ```java
	  map1.merge(num, 1, (u, v) -> u + v);
	  ```
