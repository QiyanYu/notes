	- ## Unit 1.3: Logic Gates
		- ### Logic Gates:
			- Elementary(Nand, And, Or, Not)
		- Boolean algebra can be used to abstract the behavior of logic gates.
		- Don't worry about physical artifacts.
		- **The art of logic design:** Given a gate abstraction (also referred to as *specification* or *interface*), find an efficient way to implement it using other gates that were already implemented.
	- ## Unit 1.4: Hardware Description Language
		- Multi-Bit Version of Basic Gates
			- The bits are indexed from right to left, the rightmost bit being the 0'th bit and the leftmost bit being the 15'th bit (in a 16-bit setting).

- # 3. Memory
	- ## Combinational vs. Sequential
		- The chips which are time independent, are called *combinational*: they respond to different combinations of their inputs without delay, except for the time it takes their inner chip-parts to complete the computation.
		- The outputs of *sequential* chips depend not only on the inputs in the current time but also on inputs and outputs that have been processed previously.
	- ## Unit 3.1: Sequential Logic
		- Combinatorial: `out[t] = function(in[t])`
		- Sequential: `state[t] = function(state[t-1])`
		- ### Time Matters
			- #### In reality, outputs are always delayed, due to at least two reasons:
				- First, the inputs of the chips don’t appear out of thin air; rather, the signals that represent them travel from the outputs of other chips, and this travel takes time.
				- Second, the computations that chips perform also take time; the more chip-parts the chip has—the more elaborate its logic—the more time it will take for the chip’s outputs to emerge fully formed from the chip’s circuitry.
	- ## Unit 3.2: Flip Flops
		- *Data Flip Flops*: an elementary, time-dependent logic gate that can flip and flop between two stable states: representing 0 and representing 1.

	- ## Unit 3.3: Memory Units
		- Computer programs use variables, arrays, and objects—abstractions that persist data over time. Hardware platforms support this ability by offering memory devices that know how to *maintain state*.
		- Main memory: RAM
		- Secondary memory: disks
		- Volatile/non-volatile
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1659113183991_0.png){:height 438, :width 628}
		- RAM: Random Access Memory, irrespective of the RAM size, every register can be accessed at the same time - instantaneously!

	- ## Hack Programming
		- ### Working with registers and memory

		- ### Branching
		- ### Variables
		- ### Iteration
		- ### Pointers
		- ### Input/output
	- ## Hardware Elements
		- Memory
		- Processor
		- Registers
			- The CPU-resident registers fall into two categories: *data registers*, designed to hold data values, and *address registers*, designed to hold values that can be interpreted either as data values or as memory addresses.
	- Low-level code that mentions no physical addresses is said to be *relocatable*.
	- ###  The Hack Machine Language
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1659649762308_0.png)
		- Hack instructions are designed to manipulate three 16-bit registers: a data register, denoted D, an address register, denoted A, and a selected data memory register, denoted M.
		- *D register*: To store a 16-bit value.
		- *A register*:
			- An address register: `@xxx` sets the A register to the value xxx. In addition, the @xxx instruction has two side effects.
				- First, it makes the RAM register whose address is xxx the selected memory register, denoted M.
				- Second, it makes the value of the ROM register whose address is xxx the selected instruction.
			- A data register: this is the only way to get a constant into the Hack computer. `@17; D=A`

- # 5 Computer Architecture
	- ### The von Neumann Architecture
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1662583008014_0.png)
		- *Stored program* concept: the computer's memory stores not only the data that the computer manipulates but also the instructions that tell the computer what to do.
	- ### *starvation:*
		- is when a fast processor depends on a sluggish data store for supplying its inputs and consuming its outputs.
