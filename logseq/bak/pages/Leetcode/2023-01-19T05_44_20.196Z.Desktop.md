- ## Algorithm
	- ### Brute Force
		- [[1803. Count Pairs With XOR in a Range]]
	- ### Two Pointers
		- [[1658. Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero]]
- ## Tips
	- ### Modify inputs for avoiding override default method
		- [ [[2530. maximal Score After Applying K Operations]] ]
	- ### Ceiling Function
		- For `ceiling(d/i)`, we can use `(d + i - 1) / i` to get the ceiling value.
	- ### By applying the same rule to every element in the array, we can avoid having to examine the entire array and instead just check a single item.

	- ### If we use `O(N^2)` algorithm, we should try to eliminate the time complexity.
